The new coronavirus is transmitted from one person to another as it is ‘shed’ by an infected person into the environment. The virus must survive that environment before being picked up by another person, who either inhales the virus in respiratory droplets or makes contact with virus-contaminated surfaces.

Coronaviruses mostly affect the respiratory system, which is a group of organs and tissues that allow the body to breathe.

Respiratory illnesses affect different parts of this respiratory system, such as the lungs.
